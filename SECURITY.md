## Reporting a Vulnerability

I am currently using these config files personally, so I do very much care if these configs are secure or not.

If you come accross any setting or config that you think might be harmful or insecure, please let me know. 

I will try my best to patch those as soon as possible. If you have any suitable solution for any security fixes or otherwise, you are welcome to help me out.
